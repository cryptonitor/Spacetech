Post-entropy engineering:
Where the goal isnt resisting decay, but surfing it. 
Redirecting chaos into creation
Better system. Shift from the conventional idea of a closd-loop to a biophysically-integrated open equilibrium where:

-entropy isnt loss, its a signal
-Systems are designed to degrade gracefully or self-correct syntropically.
-Components are not consumed in a linear fashion but cultivated, cycled, triggered only when necessary.


Examples in practicee:

-Heat transfer using fluids derived from microbioal/algal coils, with on-site PH control to adjust phase behaviour
-Resin post-processing where alcohol vapor leaks drive air sterilization or trap residual VOCs (Volatile Orgahnic Compounds) in living filters
// -TODO: some way for heatshields? How dissallow loss in the system? separated degredation from internal pressure?//
-Rocket staging systems where leftover fuel becomes reaction chamber cleaning vapor.
-self-growing seals, wicks, or energy carriers like hydrogels or biofoams that activate under temperature change.
-Circuitry that degrades into usable "soil" or emits light as it breaks down... turning e-ewaste into an ecological actor.
