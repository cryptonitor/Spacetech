Bridging the longterm scale of survival for life on earth with deepspace swarms of Cosmic Sentiels.

AI-based adaptive deep-orbit sentinels
Considerig orbitals ona cosmic scale to define and modify 
living, recalibrate cosmic systems

The moon gives us a previously fixed system to dynamically adapt predictations
when the next impacts on the moon 

Ephemeral orbitals on a 500year-scale creates a long-term farscale survival
