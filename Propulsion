2: Propulsion in dense gas/atmosphere: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) for fluiddynamics (outside the obvious mechanical exertion)
and materialscience to do: 
Winglike flaps emergent phenomena in the magnetic flux that results from the plasma bow upon (re-)entry, from pre-seeded structural 
inherent magnetic properties in the hull of spacecraft. 
When hull is subjected to intense solar radiation intraplanetary or upon entry to gas the magnetic properties builtin 
makes fluxdensity "flutter" like wings about the areas where sensitive organic/electronic systems.
Purpose is to deflect radiation away from organic/electronic without adding weight or expending energy.
