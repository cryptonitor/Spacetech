Reshaping space itself? Maybe. Made this shit to break on through beyond current tech:
Convergence of reflectometry, thermal transient spectroscopy and near-field signal distortion analysis, but 
layered with conceptual modeling of logic state "memory" through energetic resonance artifacts.

-Pulsed gate drive slamming it into near-saturation. Watch not for response, but for surrounding spectral disturbances.

-Use high-speed photodiode + narowband filter near IR+oscilloscope = detect miniscule thermochromatic shifts.

-Eventaully combine dithered TDR (Time-Domain Reflectometry)


Timefraeme: Maybe possible in 20 years when tech catches up . This is highly likely the standard diagnostic practice in 50 years. 
Interpreting ghost-logic: Post-signal analysis technioque...
