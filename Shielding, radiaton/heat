Materialproperties enabled by pinchforming (precise robotic sheetforming with ultraprecise dual arms)

Robots nudging material into tension, form properties by design, localized, magnetic, kinetic tension/flex, planned-dynamic buckling etc. 
for a spacecraft hull that is dynamic and adapts+responds by te interactions of the known forces it is subject to during its operation.

Localized pockets of magnetic portions interacts and are streghtened by circumferetial currents: 
Radiation hitting the hull enables the fluxdensities to itneract with highenergy particles to form a "second-skin" with a boundary-effect
vaguely (but not really) "similar" to earths solarshield.

Heatshields and radiationshields work similarly. 
Heatshields: Vibration, turbulence, kinetic forces, pressurewaves, plasmaformations: Ephemeral wing-like magnetic flux emerge from the flux of the localized fields.
These fields attenuated by the gyration of fuel to facilitate pathways of circumferential electric current such that the magnetic fields flap like wings in order to dampen shockwaves and deflect heat in the plasmabow
